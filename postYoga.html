                        <p>I first learned about the 8 Limbs of Yoga in my 200hr Yoga Teacher Training through the Yoga & Ayurveda Center. I connected with the principle immediately. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Yama’s and Niyama’s are in line with many of the teachings of Jesus Christ. I have been working to live by these principles all of my life. Aparigraha and Ishwara Pranidhana are particularly meaningful to me. They are clear principles that outline how to live a faith filled life.</p>
                        <p>I connect Aparigraha to putting your trust in God and believing that all things will work together for my own good. I connect Ishwara Pranidhana with aligning our will with the will of God. While these principles are similar, Aparigraha is necessary because we will never fully understand the mind of God in this life and while we will still have our own hopes and dreams we should strive to trust in whatever the end result may be. Ishwara Pranidhana is a higher level of living. It’s complete oneness with God. This is a lifelong pursuit. But I hope someday to follow the example of Jesus Christ and be able to say with sincerity “Not my will, but thine be done.”</p>
                        <p>In September 1995 a living prophet and 12 apostles released “The Family A Proclamation to the World” In this proclamation it says</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"></blockquote>“Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities.”
                        <p>I have actively striven to incorporate these principles in my family life since The Family Proclamation was released. The 8 Limbs of Yoga give further knowledge on how to apply these principles in my thoughts and actions.</p>
                        <p>Although the 8 Limbs of Yoga and my religious beliefs are similar, yoga is not a religion. I don't believe religion should be taught in Yoga classes or any other forms of public or group recreational activities. However, the 8 Limbs of Yoga are crucial to acknowledging the foundation of Yoga and many meditation practices. I plan to credit Patanjali and reference the Yoga Sutras once during each class</p>

                        <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
                        <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
                        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
